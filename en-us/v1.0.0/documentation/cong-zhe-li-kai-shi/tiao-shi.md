# Debugging

We intend to provide more convenient debugging functions, including debugging information and debugging tools. However, this is still under planning.

## Trace

In v1.0.0-beta.4, we support exporting key Trace messages. All messages contain the keyword "**Nlnet.Avalonia.Css**". The current output includes type mapping information, resource type factory information, code source loading information, and more.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you have any comments or suggestions about the current output, please feel free to [give](https://github.com/liwuqingxin/Avalonia.Css/issues) them to us in the repository.
{% endhint %}
