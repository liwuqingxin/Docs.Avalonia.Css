# Security

Acss is responsible for parsing code sources into Avalonia objects, which can be local files, Avalonia resources embedded in the program, and may even support other types of sources in the future, such as web resources, streaming resources, and so on. Please be aware that this may pose some risk to the program.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If privacy of code, or avoiding other security risks is important to you, be sure to carefully consider whether or not to use Acss in your situation.
